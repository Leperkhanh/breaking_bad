    <p>This is our first project in Flatiron's Software Engineering program. Originally this project was done for CLI interface but I thought it would look much better in a web browser. 
    Fortunately our next segment of studying was Sinatra, simple web framework, that enabled me to do just that. This is the result, list of Breaking bad characters with links to their full info
    and quotes if any are associated with the said character. 
    Database is populated via API call that I've placed in seeds.rb file. Reason for that is that I wanted full control, i.e. manual control of API calls and populating the database.

    For expediency sake I've used W3 school free HTML templates for the project.
